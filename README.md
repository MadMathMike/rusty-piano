# Lessons
### Playback
Tried playback provided via [playback-rs](https://crates.io/crates/playback-rs/0.4.4).
 - Seems to require libasound2-dev (Ubuntu only?)
   - https://askubuntu.com/a/1396206
 - Seems to also require nightly/beta rust compiler (which I don't want to do)
   - https://askubuntu.com/a/1396206
```
   Compiling playback-rs v0.4.4
error[E0554]: `#![feature]` may not be used on the stable release channel
```

Switched to [rodio](https://crates.io/crates/rodio).
 - Similar dependencies: https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio?tab=readme-ov-file#dependencies-linux-only

### Keyring
Crate:
 - Seems to require dbus-devel
